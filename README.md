This dataset utilizes 17 clinical features for predicting survival state of patients with liver cirrhosis. 
The survival states include 0 = D (death), 1 = C (survival), 2 = CL (survival due to liver transplantation). 
Our model will try to predict if the patient will survive without an operation, survive with a transplant 
or lose their lives.
